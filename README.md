## Categories project

### Intro

This project is currently migrating from old repositories and build and testing tools.
Does not even compile yet.
Historically, it was first written in Basic, then in Fortran, then in Assembler, then in Java, now in Scala.
Long story.

The idea is to be able to do all categorical calculations, then be able to calculate topos logic and topologies.

### Current Status
Java code works, no warnings
Scala code is in a bad condition as of today (6/24/2015)
